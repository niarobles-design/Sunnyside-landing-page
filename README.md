## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

In this challenge I have focused on learning more about accessibility and responsive design. I have started using CSS Grid and it is great. I am also happy that I have managed not to use so many media queries and my CSS is starting to look cleaner.

### Continued development

I definitely want to keep improving my responsive and accessibility skills.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS](https://benfrain.com/books/) - This helped me a lot improve my responsive design. I also learnt a bit more about accessibility thanks to this book.
